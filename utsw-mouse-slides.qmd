# Multiparental populations

```


???


- start with 8 inbred founder lines  
- inbred lines are color-coded  
- each subject represented by one homologous chromosome pair  
- over successive generations of outbreeding, subjects have smaller and smaller contiguous regions from a single inbred line  


---


# Background

- 10,000+ traits with RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry 

- Quantitative trait locus mapping identifies genetic loci that affect measurable traits

- Multiparental populations offer high-resolution QTL mapping

- New analysis tools, such as a pleiotropy test for multiparental populations, are needed 


???

- Together, high-dimensional traits and multiparental populations can advance complex trait genetics

---

# Benefits of a new pleiotropy test

- Insights into genetic architecture

- Tool for expression trait hotspot dissection

- Complements mediation analysis

???


When trying to identify an intermediate, a pleiotropy test limits the number of mediation analyses by identifying traits that share a QTL








---

# `r Citet(myBib, "jiang1995multiple")` test

- Two-parent crosses    

- Applies to two traits that co-map     

- $H_0$: Pleiotropy    

- $H_A$: Two separate QTL    



---

# `r Citet(myBib, "jiang1995multiple")` test


- Perform a two-dimensional two-QTL scan     

    - $vec(Y) = Xvec(B) + vec(E)$     
    
    - Calculate likelihood at each ordered pair of positions    

- Calculate likelihood ratio test statistic     

???

- Y: 2 traits  
- X: genotype probs for 2 markers  
- B: founder allele effects  
- E: random errors, iid within each phenotype  
- vec: stack columns

- 2d scan involves all ordered pairs of markers

# Challenges in multiparental populations

- Complex patterns of relatedness    

.soln[Multivariate random effects]

- Multiple founder lines

???

Two challenges occur at the point of relating phenotypes to genotypes



---

# Test procedure

- Perform a two-dimensional two-QTL scan     

    - $vec(Y) = Xvec(B) + vec(G) + vec(E)$     
    
    - Calculate likelihood at each ordered pair of positions    

- Calculate likelihood ratio test statistic     



???

- $G$: Polygenic random effects that depend on the kinship matrix  
    
- $E$: Random errors
  
  


---

# Test procedure

- Test statistic: $$- \log_{10} \frac{\max (\text{likelihood under pleiotropy})}{\max (\text{likelihood for separate QTL})}$$    

- Parametric bootstrap to get a $p$-value    


???

We fit the bivariate QTL models at all points on the two-dimensional grid. With the likelihoods of those model fits, we calculate a likelihood ratio test statistic.

Approximate the null distribution with the distribution of bootstrap test statistics

---

# Application

- `r Citet(myBib, c("logan2013high", "recla2014precise"), .opts = list(max.names = 1))` studied 261 Diversity Outbred mice    

- Measured about two dozen behavioral traits

- Two traits map to Chr 8:

    - "hot plate latency" (57 cM)    

    - "percent time in light" (55 cM)


???

We applied our test to freely available data from the Chesler laboratory.


Do they share a single QTL? 

We examined these two traits because they map to the same region

Hot plate latency is a measure of thermal pain sensitivity

Percent time in light is related to measures of anxiety


---

# Percent time in light


```{r percentlight, echo = FALSE, out.width = "650px"}
include_graphics("figs/percent-time-light-coef-lod-Chr8.svg")
```

???

- X axis is Chr 8 position
- Y axis is allele effect (on the trait)
- 8 lines per figure: one for each founder line

---

# Hot plate latency


```{r hotplate, echo = FALSE, out.width = "650px"}
include_graphics("figs/hot-plate-latency-coef-lod-Chr8.svg")
```



???

- Distinct allele effects patterns suggest separate QTL


---

# LOD definitions

- $$LOD(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) = ll_{10}(\lambda_1, \lambda_2) - \max_{\lambda} ll_{10}(\lambda, \lambda)$$


- $$\text{profile LOD}_{\text{trait 1}}(\lambda_1) = \max_{\lambda_2}LOD(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$$



- $$LOD_p(\lambda) = ll_{10}(\lambda, \lambda) - \max_{\lambda} ll_{10}(\lambda, \lambda)$$






---

# Profile LOD


```{r profiles, out.width = "650px", echo = FALSE}
include_graphics("figs/profile.svg", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```

???

The x axis is Chr 8 position

The y axis is LOD

There are three "traces": one for each trait and one for the pleiotropy hypothesis.

The pleiotropy trace derives from the likelihoods for the pleiotropy models (ie, the diagonal on the grid)

The "hot plate latency" profile LOD trace reveals a broad peak from 55 to 65 cM

The "percent time in light" profile LOD trace displays a sharp peak atop a broad region with higher LOD scores. 

The triangles correspond to the univariate QTL peak positions, while the circles are the profile LOD peak positions.

The two profile LOD traces achieve the same maximum value, which is the test statistic value. 



---

# Test results


- $\log_{10} \Lambda = 1.2$

- $p = 0.11$ (1000 bootstrap samples)

???

- Weak evidence for two separate QTL

    - One QTL affects "distance traveled in light"    
    
    - Second QTL affects "hot plate latency"

# Power study with local expression QTL


---

# Data

- `r Citet(myBib, "keller2018genetic", .opts = list(max.names = 1))` measured pancreatic islet gene expression levels in 378 Diversity Outbred mice

- 80 local expression QTL were identified in a 20-Mb region of Chr 19

    - local: expression trait QTL is near gene position

- Assume that a local expression QTL affects only one local expression trait


---

# Design

- Examine power with known expression trait QTL locations

    - Interlocus distance    
    - Univariate LOD    

- 4 strong, centrally located, local eQTL chosen as "anchor" traits

    - *Asah2, Lipo1, Lipo2, 4933413C19Rik*

- Pairwise pleiotropy tests each involving one anchor and one of 79 other traits


---

# Interlocus distance

# Interlocus distance

```



---

# Univariate LOD

```{r, out.height="500px"}
include_graphics("figs/lrt-v-univariate-lod-slides.svg", auto_pdf = FALSE)
```



---

# Conclusions

- $\uparrow$ Pleiotropy test statistics
   - $\uparrow$ Interlocus distance
   - $\uparrow$ Univariate LOD
